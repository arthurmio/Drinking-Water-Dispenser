# Drinking Water Dispenser
The objective of the project is to build a paid water dispenser to fill 1L bottles.

This dispenser will be located on the roadside to allow hikers to recharge their bottle and thus reduce the use of plastic.

The project is developed by Mandor which is an ecological reserve located 4km from the village of Machu Picchu in Peru, 
possessing a botanical garden with a waterfall to discover the flora and fauna, a restaurant, accommodation and a campsite.
